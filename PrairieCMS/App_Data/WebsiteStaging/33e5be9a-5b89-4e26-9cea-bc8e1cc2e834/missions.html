<div class=\"post\"><h3>Mission Trips</h3><p>Missions is a very important part of Shalom and short term mission trips is a very real way to make a difference for Christ and for Him to make a difference in the lives that go.</p><p>If you are interested in being part of a mission trip please contact the church office for the latest information on upcoming trips.</p><h2>Recent Trips:</h2><h3>Mission to Roatan:</h3><h4>Roatan Mission Trip 2010 Summary </h4><p><br />On February 12, thirteen people left from Shalom for a nine day mission trip to the island of Roatan, Honduras. They were joined at the Houston airport by a drama team from a church in Michigan and a musician from South Carolina. A team from Calvary Church Bemidji joined us after we arrived on the island. <br /><br />The team stayed at the SonRise Missionary Inn located in Sandy Bay which is owned and operated by Pastor Chuck Laird and his family. They host mission teams and provide rooms and meals so that teams can focus on their ministries. They are also a great resource for planning mission trips to the island because they are aware of the needs of the people there. <br />Ministries performed by the team included distribution of hygiene bags containing soaps, shampoo and tooth paste; rice food packets were given out and croc shoes were distributed. An orphanage was visited and we handed out over 100 breakfast baleatas (burritos) and tracts to men from la colonia before they headed to work. VBS programs were held without restriction in several public schools on the island. Some of the men framed a home on stilts for a single mom with two children in Flowers Bay. Others visited a local jail and shared their testimonies to which some of the inmates said they could relate. A garbage dump on the island was visited and people who live there or come there to rummage through the garbage received tracts and were witnessed to with the gospel. The drama and music teams performed several times during the VBS sessions and in some local churches. They were very popular and well received which led to an interview by local TV stations! <br /><br />The team also assisted with worship and Sunday school at the Calvary Chapel which is held in the SonRise Inn. The message of Jonah in the whale was a hit with the children and they got to go inside the belly of a large whale made by the VBS leader on the team. Bibles and New Testaments were distributed in both English and Spanish. <br /><br />During the course of the week, over 1000 people were touched by the team through the outreaches performed and even more through the TV programs. Several received Christ. The Lord was magnified on the island and we were blessed by the freedom we had to share the gospel with the people there. Not only were lives touched on Roatan by the Lord but those on the team were personally and spiritually blessed to have been a part of it.</p><h3>Missions to Guatemala:</h3><p>Each summer, our church joins with others to meet the needs of local villagers in Guatemala.&nbsp; This trip is planned annually and has helped with providing agriculture training, fuel efficient ways to cook, cows, building shelters, providing prescription glasses and sharing the life saving news of Jesus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Mission to Roatan:</h3><p>In June 2008,&nbsp;our church made it's first visit to Roatan, Honduras.&nbsp; A team of 19 adults from the church went to minister to the needs of the local islanders.&nbsp; One of the greatest physical needs on the island is clean water.&nbsp; This&nbsp;team helped lay the pipes to provide clean drinkable well water to over 30 homes.&nbsp; This team also lead several worship services, two, separate week-long VBS, helped finish a home, visited those in jail, provided medical expertise to the local clinic, gave out much needed&nbsp;hygiene supplies, many Bibles&nbsp;and shared the life saving news of Jesus.&nbsp; A return trip is planned for February 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Youth Mission Trips:</h3><p>The youth at Shalom have had a great history of sharing the good news and loving those in need on mission trips over the years.&nbsp; In 2008,&nbsp;the middle school students traveled to Colorado and the high school students traveled to Mexico.&nbsp; Their stories of how God moves on those trips&nbsp;are truly amazing.</p></div><p><script type=\"text/javascript\"><!--jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery('#topheaderimage').attr(\"src\",\"http://shalombaptist.org/images/worldmissionsheader.jpg\");});// --></script></p>
