[Prairie CMS](http://prairiesoft.co/) - Prairie Software CMS
=================================================================
Prairie Software is developing this CMS.  Some features are:  A data-driven plugin architecture enables flexibility in content.  An example of a plubin that is under development for this CMS is a page to present video content (Church services from YouTube).

This CMS could be easily integrated into an existing web site, it's .MVC.   It was also built with the goal in mind of making individual areas of responsibility for editors.   So a person with the right to edit one area can't access others. 

This software uses [Kendo UI controls](http://www.kendoui.com/web.aspx),  and the Kendo editor has provision for adding custom tools.    I added a custom form builder tool to my CMS.   So any form is really easy for anyone to build into their pages.

Prairie CMS is a .Net 4.0 Entity Framework MVC app written in C#.  It uses SQL Server for data storage.  (Express, Compact, or Standard)

The scripts in this CMS leverage these opensource projects:
boilerplatejs
bootstrap
crossroads
flot
