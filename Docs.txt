Plugin Architecture:

Table CMSLevelMapping contains entries for content types supported by the software.
Page
Sub_Page
Form
Sub_Div
Email
Module

Table CMSContent_Type contains the code which is used for each content type.  
These level definitions are not fully coded.
An example of one that works is Form and these are the user defined form items that can be inserted into the content of the page.
Module content type defines the tags which can be inserted into the content of the page - {{MessagesView}} for example will load up an instance of IMessagesView if one exists and the IMessagesView will be responsible for injecting html into the page.

To use a plugin module, add a reference to PrairiePluginLib to your project.  In your project, add a public class that implements interface IModule.  IModule interface defines a method called GetHtml() - this will be called by Prairie CMS when the content which is being loaded contains an embedded string which matches the pattern:
"{{" + YourModule.EntryControllerName + "}}";
