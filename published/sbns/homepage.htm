        <p>Shalom is a church with origins tracing back to a small group of believers who longed
                                for something more than just going through the motions as they found their faith
                                in Christ.</p>

        <p>In 1882 this group joined two other congregations to build the Christian Apostolic
                                Baptist Society. As the congregation outgrew their facility, they eventually purchased
                                a larger building in 1958.</p>

        <p>In 1980, this congregation had outgrown their facilities again, and once more, built
                                a new facility, calling it Shalom Baptist Church. We have been in this building
                                ever since, remaining true to the gospel, and watching God work in immeasurable
                                ways.</p>

        <p>The church is once again experiencing growing pains and we have seen that God is
                                on the move at Shalom and in this community. Its time to close the gap between where
                                we have been the last 33 years and where God is taking us now. 75% of American churches
                                have plateaued or are decreasing in size for a variety of reasons, yet Shalom has
                                experienced recent growth.</p>

        <p>We believe that God has given Shalom a specific vision, "to immerse the Hutchinson
                                area in the grace of Christ to break down barriers of cynicism and confusion in
                                people's lives." Not much different that the group of believers who first started
                                this church over 125 years ago.</p>

        <p>By staying status quo, there is a risk of losing that hunger, that growth. Jesus
                                gives us this Great Commission, “Therefore go and make disciples of all nations,
                                baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
                                and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you“(Matthew 28:19-20). The
                                time is now and the how by taking "The Next Step" towards ministry expansion.</p>
